House price prediction model


Overview of the project:
  The project is a machine-learning based House Price Prediction System that allows users to enter property details and receive an estimated price. It uses a RandomForestRegressor model trained on sample data containing bedrooms, bathrooms, area, and location, which is encoded and scaled using StandardScaler. After training, both the model and scaler are saved using joblib for reuse.The system also sets up a SQLite database with a table called predictions, where every prediction made by the user is stored along with the input details. Users interact with the program through a simple text-based menu that lets them choose to predict a house price, view previously saved predictions, or exit the application. When a prediction is made, the program collects user input, processes the data, generates the price, displays the result, and saves it to the database. When viewing history, all stored records are retrieved and shown to the user. Overall, the project combines machine learning, data storage, and user interaction in a single, easy-to-use system.

  Features:
    The project trains a machine-learning model using a RandomForestRegressor to estimate house prices based on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, total area, and location. It converts location into numerical form and scales all input features with a StandardScaler to improve the accuracy of predictions. The trained model and scaler are saved as .pkl files using joblib so that the system can make future predictions without retraining.The application automatically creates a SQLite database table called predictions, which is used to store every prediction along with the corresponding house details. It provides a simple menu-driven interface that allows the user to choose whether to predict a house price, view the saved prediction history, or exit the program. When a prediction is made, the system collects user input, generates the price, displays the result, and saves it in the database. The user can also view all previously stored records, which are retrieved directly from the database. The program continues running in a loop until the user chooses to exit, making it an interactive and user-friendly application.

  Steps to install and Run the Project:
    First, make sure that Python is installed on your system. Next, install the required Python libraries by running the command pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib in your terminal or command prompt, because these packages are needed for data handling and machine-learning operations. After that, save the provided code into a Python file, such as house_price_system.py, and keep it in a folder where you want the project to run. There is no need to manually create the database because the program will automatically generate the SQLite database file named house_data.db when it runs for the first time.Once everything is set up, open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file, and run the project using the command python house_price_system.py. The program will train the model, save the required files, and then display a menu on the screen. You can follow the on-screen instructions to predict house prices, view prediction history, or exit the application. The project will continue running until you choose to close it.

Instructions for Testing:
  To begin testing the project, first run the program using the command python house_price_system.py in your terminal after installing the required dependencies. When the menu appears, select the option to predict a house price by entering 1. The program will then ask for the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, the area in square feet, and the location. You can enter sample values such as three bedrooms, two bathrooms, 1400 square feet, and “city” to check whether the prediction is generated correctly. After submitting the details, the program should display a predicted price and confirm that the result has been saved to the database.

Next, return to the main menu and choose the second option to view prediction history. This will allow you to verify that the previously generated prediction has been stored successfully in the database. You can repeat the process with different inputs, including suburb or rural locations, to ensure that the model handles all cases properly. It is also useful to test invalid inputs, such as typing letters instead of numbers or entering an unsupported location, to confirm that the program responds appropriately.

Finally, you can close the application by selecting the exit option from the menu. After exiting, you may also check that the house_data.db file and the saved model files have been created in the project folder to confirm that the system is functioning as expected.
